Phases of Pack Discovery/Indexing/Loading:

1. **Global Discovery** (`boot-global-discovering`):
   - The system starts by discovering all available packs across the global content roots.
   - Scans predefined directories or directories marked as content roots for possible packs (e.g., mods, appPacks, viewPacks).
   - Purpose: Gather all the packs in the system that can potentially be activated or loaded.

2. **Global Examining** (`boot-global-examining`):
   - The system examines each discovered pack, reading its metadata, manifest files, and other essential details.
   - Purpose: Ensure the system understands the dependencies, configurations, and structure of each pack before attempting to load or activate them.

3. **Global Loading** (`boot-global-loading`):
   - The system begins loading actual resources: schemas, configuration files, assets, and runtime code (if necessary).
   - Purpose: Register schemas, validate configurations, and load any runtime-specific code, ensuring everything is ready before the system can use the pack.

4. **Global Ready** (`boot-global-ready`):
   - All packs have been fully loaded and validated, and the system is ready to execute logic based on the loaded resources.
   - onLoad() is called for packs that have this entry method.
   - Purpose: Final step before the app can function, ensuring all resources and packs are ready.

5. **App Loading** (`app-loading`):
   - The app-specific packs (appPacks, viewPacks) are loaded, including any additional resources required by the app (e.g., mods, assets).
   - Purpose: Load everything related to the app's operation, including any view-specific or mod-specific resources that need to be initialized.

6. **App Generating** (`app-generating`):
   - The system runs generator scripts or any necessary runtime logic (e.g., generating savePack, running app-specific code).
   - Purpose: Generate necessary runtime data for the app, ensuring all configurations and resources are correctly initialized.

7. **App Finished** (`app-finished`):
   - The app's loading and initialization are complete. Save files are created and stored.
   - Purpose: The app is fully initialized and ready for use, and no further loading is required.

8. **View Loading** (`view-loading`):
   - The system loads any view-specific resources for the given view (e.g., viewPacks, mods, assets).
   - Purpose: Ensure that all resources required for a specific view are loaded and available for rendering.

9. **View Providing** (`view-providing`):
   - This phase involves serving necessary files to the frontend, including potentially compiled files (e.g., JavaScript, CSS).
   - It might involve compiling or transforming certain files on the fly before serving them to the frontend.
   - Purpose: Provide all the files required for the frontend, ensuring it has the necessary resources to render the view.

10. **Mod Examined** (`mod-examined`):
    - A mod is found, and its manifest is processed. This phase checks if the mod has any runtime code or resources to be loaded.
    - Purpose: Ensure that all mods are correctly processed and ready to be loaded when their turn comes.

11. **Mod Loaded** (`mod-python-loaded`, `mod-javascript-loaded`):
    - The mod (either Python or JavaScript) is loaded, and its onLoad() method is executed if defined.
    - For Python mods, the system imports the module and runs its initialization code. For JavaScript mods, the system serves compiled files and ensures the frontend can load them.
    - Purpose: Execute and initialize mod code, making it functional within the app.

12. **Mod Finalized** (`mod-python-finalized`, `mod-javascript-finalized`):
    - Once a mod has been fully loaded and initialized, it is marked as finalized.
    - The mod is now ready for interaction with other system components and can function fully within the app.
    - Purpose: Mark the mod as fully functional and ready for use in the system.

### Updates about **PackManager** and **Mod Loading**:

- **PackManager**:
  - **PackManager** is the UI for managing the loading and activation of packs, including **required** and **recommended** mods.
  - **Recommended mods** are only suggestions. They are not mandatory, and users can choose whether or not to load them based on their needs.
  - When creating a **savePack** from an **appPack**, **PackManager** will:
    - Show which mods are **required** and ensure they are selected.
    - Display **recommended mods** and allow the user to choose whether to download and use them.
    - Detect and display any **conflicts** or **overwrites** between mods.
    - Allow the user to **alter the order** of mod loading, if necessary, to resolve conflicts or adjust priorities.
    - Save the **mod order** to preserve the user's custom order.
    - On updates, **PackManager** will ask the user if they want to update the order or keep it as is.

- **Mod Loading**:
  - **Mod loading** is the process of resolving, discovering, and initializing mods within the app.
  - Mods are loaded based on the **activation plan** generated by the **InternalPackManager**.
  - **Python mods** (backend) and **JavaScript mods** (frontend) can have dependencies on each other, but loading should not necessarily wait for frontend mods to be loaded.
  - **Frontend mods** (JavaScript) might need to be paused until the frontend is connected and can serve the necessary resources.
  - Backend mods can initialize first, and once the frontend is ready, the **onLoad** for frontend mods can be triggered.
  - **PackManager** can be used to detect and manage dependencies between **Python mods** and **JavaScript mods**, ensuring that **backend mods** are initialized before the frontend is available, and frontend mods are only loaded once the necessary backend resources are available.
  - **Mod load order** can be influenced by user preferences, with the ability to **alter the order** and ensure the correct dependencies are resolved.
