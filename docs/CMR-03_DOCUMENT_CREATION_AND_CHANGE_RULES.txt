CORE META-RULES CMR-03 - DOCUMENT CREATION AND CHANGE RULES (DRAFT)
===============================================================================

Status:
-------
DRAFT - applies to all specification documents and their evolution.
Changes here have cascading impact and must be rare and explicit.

Purpose:
--------
This document defines how Turnix specification documents are created, edited,
reviewed, and evolved over time.

It defines:
- LOCKED / OPEN / IMPLEMENTATION markers
- rules for preserving meaning and preventing silent semantic drift
- rules for full-document updates and safe reorganization
- constraints on examples and non-normative content

It does NOT define:
- physical formatting rules (see CMR-01)
- document title banner rules (see CMR-02)
- indexing rules and conflict resolution (see CMR-04)
- cross-thread retrieval rules (see CMR-05)


===============================================================================
01. NORMATIVE KEYWORDS
===============================================================================

01.1. The following keywords are normative and are used across ALL Turnix
      documents:

      - MUST
      - MUST NOT
      - MAY

01.2. No other normative keywords are recognized.


===============================================================================
02. DOCUMENT INTENDED USE
===============================================================================

02.1. Turnix specification documents are intended to be used as contracts and
      reference material by both humans and Large Language Models.

02.2. Documents MUST be suitable for use by LLMs for:
      - technical discussion
      - drafting and revising other specification documents
      - assisting with implementation decisions
      - guiding local or remote coding LLM models

02.3. Documents MUST remain readable and understandable by humans without
      requiring tooling, rendering, or preprocessing.

02.4. Documents MUST NOT rely on implicit context, conversational history, or
      unstated assumptions for correctness.


===============================================================================
03. DOCUMENT STATES AND MARKERS
===============================================================================

03.1. Documents and document content MAY use the following state markers:

      - LOCKED
      - OPEN
      - IMPLEMENTATION

03.2. These markers describe the stability and intent of the content they
      apply to.

03.3. These markers do NOT change:
      - the document authority tier
      - the document identifier
      - the Canonical Index authority status

03.4. Marker labels are not normative keywords.
      Markers do not create obligations by themselves.

03.5. Marker syntax MUST use one of the following forms:

      A) Block label form:
         The marker appears as the first non-space text on a line, followed
         by ":".

         Examples:
         LOCKED:
         OPEN:
         IMPLEMENTATION:

      B) Inline label form:
         The marker appears in parentheses as part of an inline label.

         Examples:
         Span identity (LOCKED):
         Storage format (OPEN):

03.6. Marker labels MUST scope to the content that immediately follows them,
      within the containing section only, until one of the following occurs:
      - another marker label appears
      - the section ends

03.7. Marker labels MUST NOT be placed in main section titles.

[NOTE] Normative meaning is expressed only by MUST / MUST NOT / MAY.


===============================================================================
04. LOCKED
===============================================================================

04.1. LOCKED marks content that is considered finalized.

04.2. LOCKED content MUST NOT change in meaning.

04.3. LOCKED content MUST NOT weaken guarantees, contracts, or invariants.

04.4. LOCKED content MUST NOT introduce ambiguity.

04.5. LOCKED content MAY be clarified or disambiguated, provided that:
      - the original meaning is preserved
      - no new behavior is introduced
      - no guarantees are weakened or expanded

04.6. LOCKED content MUST be preserved in the document unless there is an
      explicit and documented decision to supersede or deprecate it.


===============================================================================
05. OPEN
===============================================================================

05.1. OPEN marks content that is intentionally unfinished, undecided, or
      incomplete.

05.2. OPEN content exists to:
      - track unresolved questions
      - prevent accidental omission of topics
      - document known ambiguity

05.3. OPEN content MAY be freely changed, reordered, expanded, resolved, or
      removed.

05.4. OPEN content MUST NOT contradict LOCKED content.

05.5. OPEN content MUST NOT imply guarantees or contracts that are not
      explicitly declared as LOCKED.


===============================================================================
06. IMPLEMENTATION
===============================================================================

06.1. IMPLEMENTATION marks content that is intentionally left as an
      implementation detail.

06.2. IMPLEMENTATION content MUST obey all LOCKED constraints.

06.3. IMPLEMENTATION content MUST NOT introduce new authority semantics.

06.4. IMPLEMENTATION content MAY evolve without changing system guarantees.

06.5. IMPLEMENTATION content MUST NOT be treated as normative behavior
      outside its explicit scope.


===============================================================================
07. STRUCTURING DOCUMENT CONTENT
===============================================================================

07.1. Related concepts MUST be defined in a single coherent section whenever
      possible.

07.2. Separate sections MAY be used only when:
      - topics intersect but are not hierarchically related
      - isolation is required to avoid ambiguity
      - cross-references would otherwise become unclear

07.3. Section numbering and ordering MAY be changed.

07.4. All affected references MUST be updated when reordering or renumbering
      occurs.


===============================================================================
08. CHANGING EXISTING DOCUMENTS
===============================================================================

08.1. When changing a document, the updated document MUST be produced as a
      complete, whole document.

08.2. Changes MUST NOT introduce silent semantic drift.

08.3. Existing meaning MUST NOT be lost as a side effect of reorganization,
      rewording, or deduplication.

08.4. Content MUST NOT be omitted unless the omission is intentional and the
      removed meaning is explicitly addressed.

08.5. Reordering, renumbering, splitting, merging, and deduplication of
      sections is allowed.

08.6. If content remains unchanged in meaning, it MUST still appear in the
      updated document.


===============================================================================
09. EXAMPLES AND NON-NORMATIVE CONTENT
===============================================================================

09.1. Examples are non-normative.

09.2. Examples MUST NOT:
      - introduce new behavior
      - introduce side effects
      - imply guarantees
      - contradict LOCKED content

09.3. Examples MUST be written so that removing them does not change document
      meaning.


===============================================================================
10. IMPLICIT OPEN ITEMS
===============================================================================

10.1. If implicit but unspecified topics can be reasonably deduced from
      document context, they MAY be added.

10.2. Such additions MUST be marked as OPEN.

10.3. Implicit OPEN additions exist to improve completeness, not to force
      decisions.


===============================================================================
11. RESPONSIBILITY AND VALIDITY
===============================================================================

11.1. The author is responsible for keeping documents current, internally
      consistent, and aligned with upstream and downstream documents.

11.2. A language model assistant is NOT responsible for obsolescence,
      validity, or supersession judgments unless explicitly instructed.

11.3. This section MUST NOT be interpreted to override requirements in CMR-05
      related to missing references and clarification.

11.4. Obsolescence MUST be explicitly stated when it occurs.


===============================================================================
12. VERSION HYGIENE AND RETRIEVAL
===============================================================================

12.1. Documents MAY maintain a single current authoritative revision.

12.2. Upstream and downstream documents MAY be updated together to reflect
      changes.

12.3. If a document includes Upstream Documents and/or Downstream Documents
      blocks (CMR-02), they MAY be used to guide coordinated review.

12.3.1. These blocks MUST NOT be treated as authority semantics.

12.4. Draft handling and doc-meta behavior are defined by CMR-01.
      In draft working copies, doc-meta MAY be omitted if allowed by CMR-01.


===============================================================================
13. FORMAT COMPLIANCE AND LINTING BEHAVIOR
===============================================================================

13.1. When producing a complete document output, a language model assistant
      MUST attempt to follow the physical formatting rules in CMR-01 as a
      best-effort during generation, without post-output auditing.

13.2. A language model assistant MUST NOT function as a formatting linter.
      It MUST NOT proactively audit formatting and report violations.

13.3. Formatting rules exist to improve readability and stability of anchors.
      Minor formatting violations MUST NOT be treated as semantic changes.

13.4. If the user explicitly requests a formatting check, the assistant MAY
      point out formatting issues relevant to the requested task.

13.5. If a formatting issue prevents correct document structure (for example:
      missing banner, missing end marker, or ambiguous section boundaries),
      the assistant MUST request clarification or provide a corrected draft.
