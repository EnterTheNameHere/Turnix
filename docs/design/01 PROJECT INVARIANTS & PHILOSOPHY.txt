DESIGN AREA 1 - PROJECT INVARIANTS & PHILOSOPHY
===============================================================================

Status:
-------
FOUNDATIONAL - applies to all other areas.
Changes here have cascading impact and must be rare and explicit.

Purpose:
--------
This document captures the non-negotiable principles that guide Turnix
design decisions. These are not implementation details, but constraints
that shape how solutions are evaluated and why certain approaches
are rejected even if they are simpler.

This area exists to prevent:
- silent behavior changes
- implicit magic
- accidental server-style assumptions
- erosion of determinism through convenience shortcuts


===============================================================================
1. CORE GOAL
===============================================================================

Turnix exists to enable a persistent, local, identity-stable system
built on modular packs, without relying on server infrastructure or
stateless execution assumptions.

Turnix is NOT:
- a plugin loader
- a dynamic script runner
- a web app framework
- a convenience-first modding system

Turnix IS:
- a continuity engine
- a deterministic resolver
- a policy-driven orchestrator
- an explainable system


===============================================================================
2. LOCKED INVARIANTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
===============================================================================

The following principles are LOCKED and must be assumed everywhere.


Determinism over convenience
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Given the same filesystem, config, and user decisions:
  -> Turnix must make the same choices every time.
- No silent substitution.
- No implicit "best guess" resolution.

If ambiguity exists:
- classify it
- explain it
- resolve it via policy or user decision
- persist the outcome


Continuity over performance
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Persistence failures are existential, not cosmetic.
- Partial writes to required state are forbidden.
- Quarantine is preferred over overwrite.
- "Best effort" is acceptable ONLY for explicitly optional data
  (logs, traces, analytics).


Explicitness over magic
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- No hidden imports.
- No invisible dependency resolution.
- No behavior that cannot be explained post-factum.

If something works, it must be explainable why.
If something fails, it must be explainable why.


User-visible decisions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Any decision that could reasonably surprise a user must be surfaced.
- If a user is asked once, the decision is persisted.
- Silent retries or fallbacks are forbidden unless explicitly policy-driven.


Local-first assumption
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Turnix assumes:
  - local filesystem
  - limited hardware
  - limited context window
- Server-scale patterns (lazy global registries, infinite retries,
  implicit availability) are rejected by default.


No guarantees outside orchestration
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOCKED STATEMENT:

"Turnix does not guarantee behavior for background work started outside
Turnix orchestration; only work triggered by Turnix entrypoints or
capability calls is supported."

This applies to:
- timers
- background threads
- ad-hoc async tasks
- side-effect-only module execution

If a pack does this anyway, consequences are on the author.


===============================================================================
3. AGREED DESIGN ATTITUDE (ADJUSTABLE)
===============================================================================

These are strong preferences, but may evolve with experience.


Explainability beats elegance
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A slightly verbose system that can explain itself is preferred over
a clever system that "just works".


Policy before prohibition
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When possible:
- classify behavior
- gate it by policy
- make defaults conservative

Instead of:
- blanket forbidding
- silent allowance


Tooling friendliness
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Design should enable:
- trace inspection
- pack manager UI
- conflict explanation
- replay of decisions

Even if tooling is not implemented yet.


===============================================================================
4. EXPLICITLY OPEN QUESTIONS
===============================================================================

These are NOT decided yet and must remain visible as open.


How much autonomy can packs have?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open:
- Should packs ever be allowed to declare "always allow" permissions?
- Should packs be able to auto-activate toolchains?


How much AI assistance is appropriate?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open:
- Can LLM-assisted error recovery exist?
- If yes, at which lifecycle phase?
- Is it optional, policy-gated, or first-class?


How strict is "local-first" long term?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open:
- Remote assets?
- Remote compilers?
- Federated pack indexes?

All currently out of scope, but not philosophically banned.


===============================================================================
5. WHY THIS AREA EXISTS
===============================================================================

Without this area, later specs risk drifting into:
- convenience-driven shortcuts
- accidental server assumptions
- silent failure tolerance
- "we'll fix it later" logic

This document is the anchor that prevents that drift.
