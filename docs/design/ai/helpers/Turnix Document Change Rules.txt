TURNIX DOCUMENT CHANGE RULES
===============================================================================

## Purpose:

These rules define how Turnix design documents may be modified, extended,
or corrected without breaking semantic integrity, historical traceability,
or cross-area consistency.

They exist to prevent:

* silent semantic drift
* accidental redefinition of locked behavior
* loss of design intent
* contradictory authority across documents

===============================================================================
1. AUTHORITY HIERARCHY (MANDATORY)
===============================================================================

1) **Design Area documents are authoritative.**
2) Optional Design Areas are authoritative *only within their scope*.
3) Tooling notes, comments, or examples are NEVER authoritative.

If a conflict exists:
→ Design Area documents always win.

Status markers defined in the Canonical Index are binding:

* LOCKED — normative and final
* IMPLEMENTATION — normative within implementation scope, constrained by LOCKED
* OPEN — not finalized, non-binding beyond explicit LOCKED constraints

===============================================================================
2. STATUS CLASS DISCIPLINE
===============================================================================

When modifying any document, the status of a section MUST be respected.

LOCKED sections:

* MUST NOT change meaning
* MUST NOT weaken guarantees
* MUST NOT introduce ambiguity
* MAY only be clarified, never redefined

IMPLEMENTATION sections:

* MUST obey all LOCKED constraints
* MUST NOT introduce new authority semantics
* MAY refine concrete mechanisms
* MAY evolve without changing system guarantees

OPEN sections:

* MAY evolve
* MUST NOT contradict LOCKED sections
* MUST NOT imply guarantees not formally declared

Promotion rules:

* OPEN → LOCKED requires explicit revision and review
* IMPLEMENTATION → LOCKED requires justification and cross-area validation
* LOCKED → OPEN is prohibited without explicit deprecation process

===============================================================================
3. WHAT YOU MAY CHANGE
===============================================================================

You MAY:

* Clarify wording without changing meaning
* Add explicit constraints that were previously implicit
* Move behavior descriptions to a more appropriate Design Area
* Add rationale sections (clearly labeled)
* Add cross-references to authoritative documents
* Mark behavior as discouraged / unsupported if already implied
* Tighten boundaries to remove ambiguity
* Refine IMPLEMENTATION details without altering guarantees

You MAY add:

* warnings
* discouragement language
* non-normative guidance
* explicit “this does NOT do X” statements

===============================================================================
4. WHAT YOU MUST NOT CHANGE
===============================================================================

You MUST NOT:

* Change the meaning of a LOCKED section
* Introduce new behavior without placing it in the correct Design Area
* Redefine existing terms (activation, resolution, importing, etc.)
* Add fallback, guessing, or “best effort” semantics
* Introduce execution paths not mediated by Turnix orchestration
* Allow new cross-pack access paths implicitly
* Add “magic” behavior that cannot be traced or explained
* Introduce new authority semantics inside IMPLEMENTATION sections

You MUST NOT:

* Rely on reader interpretation
* Assume “common sense”
* Assume language-specific behavior (Python/JavaScript quirks)
* Introduce side effects via examples

===============================================================================
5. HOW TO MAKE A CHANGE (PROCESS)
===============================================================================

Before changing text:

1. Identify:

   * which Design Area owns the behavior
   * whether the behavior is LOCKED, IMPLEMENTATION, or OPEN

2. Cross-check:

   * Decision Ledger (intent alignment)
   * related Design Areas (boundaries)
   * frontend/backend split
   * activation vs import vs resolution separation
   * authority boundaries (state vs trace vs journal)

3. Decide:

   * clarification only?
   * correction of inconsistency?
   * IMPLEMENTATION refinement?
   * promotion from OPEN to LOCKED (requires explicit justification)?

If unsure:
→ STOP and flag for review instead of guessing.

===============================================================================
6. REQUIRED STYLE WHEN MODIFYING
===============================================================================

When modifying a document:

* Write as if the reader has NEVER seen previous versions
* Do NOT reference prior drafts
* Do NOT rely on implied context
* Preserve all existing semantics unless explicitly superseded
* Keep language precise and literal
* Avoid metaphors and implementation-specific assumptions

If semantics change:

* It MUST be intentional
* It MUST be explicit
* It MUST be cross-checked
* It MUST declare whether it affects LOCKED or IMPLEMENTATION scope

===============================================================================
7. FINAL SAFETY CHECK
===============================================================================

Before accepting a change, ask:

* Does this introduce a new execution path?
* Does this allow behavior without orchestration?
* Does this blur activation vs import?
* Does this weaken determinism?
* Does this reduce explainability?
* Does this introduce authority where none existed before?

If YES to any:
→ revision required.
